# UniSphere

> **Stay Updated. Stay Connected.**

UniSphere is a modern, student-centric campus hub designed to streamline university communication. It serves as a centralized platform for announcements, events, resource sharing, lost & found, and community engagement — accessible from both web and mobile.

Originally conceived as a procedural PHP application, UniSphere has been meticulously rebuilt into a robust **Grails 6 MVC** backend with a native **Expo React Native** mobile app.

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or 17
- **Node.js:** Version 18+
- **Expo Go** app on your phone (for mobile testing)

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd grails-app

# Windows
.\gradlew.bat bootRun

# macOS/Linux
./gradlew bootRun
```

The server starts at `http://0.0.0.0:8090`.

### 2. Configure Mobile API URL

Edit `unisphere-mobile/constants/Config.ts` and set your computer's local IP:

```typescript
const DEV_LOCAL_IP = '192.168.x.x';  // ← Your machine's LAN IP
const DEV_PORT = '8090';
```

> **Tip:** Your IP is shown in the Metro output: `Metro waiting on exp://<YOUR_IP>:8081`

### 3. Start the Mobile App

```bash
cd unisphere-mobile
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android) or Camera (iOS).

### Seeded Data

`BootStrap.groovy` provisions the database with initial user accounts on first run, including an admin account for testing announcements and events.
